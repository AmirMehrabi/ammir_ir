I’m on a journey to redeem myself. This all started when I took her hand where I wasn’t supposed to. You see, I made an unfortunate and unforgivable mistake.

Not just one, I made many, many mistakes during the time we spent together.

I know she tried to be forgiving. But who can just pardon a guilty act, a stab in the back? Such mistakes can have an irreversible effect on relationships. Even if You have learned from the mistakes and would never repeat them.

I don’t say I deserve a second chance, because I very well know that by forgiving too readily, we can be badly hurt.

But think about it, what if our universe was based on different set of rules? Suppose you could tell her: ‘I didn’t mean to hurt you,’ and she would say: ‘It’s okay, I understand,’ and she would not turn away and get out of your life, and life would just proceed as nothing, nothing happened? We truly could be wiser for the experience and lead a better life.

Wouldn’t you agree?
