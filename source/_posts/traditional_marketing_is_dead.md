Traditional marketing is dead. The era where you could advertise, call or spam your way into presence is over. Making sale calls won’t get you where you need to be today. The only way to win in this game is to be talked about by people. And no one talks about “the average” one. That’s why it’s important more than anytime, to be REMARKABLE.
