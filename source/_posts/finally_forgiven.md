“Is she coming at all?  What am I going to say to her?  I don’t want her to think less of me”, I told myself while I was waiting. She stopped by our mutual friend’s bookstore not an hour ago. Before she left, she told me she might come back to see me. I hadn’t seen or talked to her for a couple of months. When she came back, I was confused and nervous about her being here with me at the same time. Didn’t know what to do, didn’t know what to say. Didn’t want to make her uncomfortable, and looking back at my record, handling these situations isn’t exactly my area of expertise. She, on the other hand, is able to communicate to people just fine.

So when she finally came to me and said that I’m forgiven, I was so relieved. During this couple of months, I asked for her forgiveness on a number of occasions, and got turned down every time.  You see, I made an unforgivable mistake and I think she’s got every right to be angry. I abused her trust. But I have learned from my mistakes. I truly am ashamed of them and gonna try not to harm my friends from now on. That’s a promise.
