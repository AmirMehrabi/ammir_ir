I recently came close to having a “nigga moment”. According to Huey Freeman, a nigga moment is where ignorance overwhelms the mind of an otherwise logical negro male, causing him to act in an illogical, self-destructive manner.

I am ashamed. Not because of the mentioned accident, no. I wouldn’t mind a good fist-fight every now and then. But because at the moment, I couldn’t even listen to my partner who was trying to stop me from my own stupidity. I let her down.

PS: My brother had a nigga moment the other day, leaving him with a broken nose. Conclusion? Nigga moments are bad for your health.
