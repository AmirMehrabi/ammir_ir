>Col. Slade: As I came in here, I heard those words, “cradle of leadership”. Well, when the bow breaks, the cradle will fall. And it has fallen here, it has fallen! Makers of men, creators of leaders- be careful what kind of leaders you’re producing here. I don’t know if Charlie’s silence here today is right or wrong; I’m not a judge or jury. But I can tell you this: he won’t sell anybody out to buy his future! And that, my friends, is called integrity. That’s called courage. Now that’s the stuff leaders should be made of. Now I have come to the crossroads in my life. I always knew what the right path was; without exception, I knew. But I never took it. You know why? It was too…damn…hard. Now here’s Charlie, he’s come to the crossroads. He has chosen a path. It’s the right path. It’s a path made of principle, that leads to character. Let him continue on his journey. You hold this boy’s future in your hands, committee! It’s a valuable future. Believe me! Don’t destroy it, protect it! embrace it! It’s gonna make you proud one day, I promise you.
