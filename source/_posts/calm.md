I’m translating a book called [It Doesn’t Have To be Crazy at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780) written by [Jason Fried](https://www.ted.com/speakers/jason_fried). I’m planning to publish the translation online, so I was looking for a Static Site Generator and came across Jigsaw by accident. The fact that it’s powered by Laravel got me so excited that I jumped straight to action.

Jigsaw doesn’t provide you with a starter skeleton. Instead, you must build your template from zero all by yourself. But with a default directory structure similar to Laravel, it’s easy to get started for PHP developers. So easy that I’m thinking to migrate this blog to Jigsaw after almost 6 years of ups and downs with the almighty WordPress.

Jigsaw, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
