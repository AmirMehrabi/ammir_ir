I’m gonna miss the old man when he’s gone. I remember how he used to kiss me when I was a kid. I would get angry and scream at him because of his sharp mustache. “I don’t feel young and alive anymore”, he told me the other day. “Time passes in a snap of a finger, you wake up one day, you look at the mirror and see that you’ve aged 50 years without even noticing.”

Sure as shit I’m gonna miss the old man.
